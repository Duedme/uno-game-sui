# UNO

UNO based card game.

This card game contains the functionalities of UNO. It contains numbered colored cards so that everyone can collect and play them. Special cards such as +2, +4, reverse, etc. have not been implemented in the current version of the game. Wait for them soon.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

To play this game all you need is to install [SUI](https://docs.sui.io/build/install). At this time you can only play from calls to functions to the Sui network from your console. However, there will soon be a more user-friendly version.

### Prerequisites
